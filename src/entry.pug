p We’re happy to invite you to <em>Submerged – on rivers and their interrupted flow</em>, the first programme in our new space in Talaat Harb street. <em>Submerged</em> extends over more than two months and consists of an exhibition, screenings, discussions and a workshop. Through artistic practices that appropriate satellite images and archival material, listen to oral histories and engage with the materiality of water, the works in the exhibition underline the difference between an everyday relationship to the river and to nature vs the macro plans made from looking at maps and territory from above. See you on Tuesday, 9 October at 7 pm for our first public event at 27 Talaat Harb Street!
